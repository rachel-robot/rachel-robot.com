# About Me


Hello and welcome to my online teaching portfolio and blog!


My name is Rachel Luczkowski and I am a recent graduate of Bank Street College with a Masters of Science in Education. I have my initial certificate to teach in New York State and I am working full time in a kindergarten classroom. I currently live in Brooklyn with my turtle, my cat, a Frenchman and more Ikea furniture than is probably healthy.

# Interest in Education   

My interest in education stems from growing up in a household with a teacher. My mother taught for over twenty-five years in both public and private schools. As the daughter of a teacher, I often found myself in the position of helping her out in the classroom. It was there that I gained my first real experience working with students by tutoring them in reading and writing. I remember enjoying the fact that I was able to make a difference even though I was just a kid myself.

During college I had a few unique opportunities working in museum education that made me feel certain I would end up in that line of work. However, my classroom fieldwork in graduate school changed everything. After my first placement with a fifth grade classroom I knew that I wanted to be in a school. Unlike working in museum education, where you really only have one chance to connect and relay information to your audience, working in a classroom lets you really build up knowledge and make it meaningful. After a few wonderful student teaching placements where I put this approach into action, I decided that becoming a teacher was the best choice for me.
