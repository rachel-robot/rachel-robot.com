# Teaching philosophy

My approach to the classroom encompasses three main ideas: creating an environment of active participation, meeting the unique needs of individual learners and providing opportunities to connect and reflect on learning.

## Creating an Environment of Active Participation

I find that students learn best when they are actively involved in the learning process. Students should be problem solvers and planners, role players and researchers, creators and debaters. They should be given opportunities to construct their own knowledge through play, direct experiences and social interactions while focusing on the "process" versus the "product". As a teacher in this environment of participation, my role is to facilitate and guide this learning by helping students establish central questions and lines of inquiry to explore. This approach gives children a voice in their education and helps them to establish critical thinking skills.

## Meeting the Unique Needs of Individual Learners

Students arrive at school with vastly different experiences and interests. As a teacher, I find it is important to get to know students on a deeper level because there is often a correlation between those experiences and interests and student performance in the classroom. I can provide more meaningful differentiation for students if I know what factors may be contributing to their strengths and weaknesses in classroom content.

In addition to knowing my students, I also find it is important to offer multiple ways of engaging with content. Intelligence is varied and students should have opportunities to demonstrate that intelligence.

## Providing Opportunities to Connect and Reflect on Learning

While education is often framed in terms of teaching academics, it is equally important that students be taught social, emotional and ethical competencies. Students should learn how to make connections across disciplines and see their classroom as an extension of their community. Teaching these other skills helps students to see the "bigger picture" and realize that the work they are doing is meaningful and applicable to their life outside of school.
