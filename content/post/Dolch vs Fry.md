In developing Ah-choo! for the Teachers Pay Teachers store I had to do a little bit of research about sight words to figure out what would be the best to offer. When I played the game with my America Reads students I worked with words from their word wall and unfortunately, I never thought to ask about the list from which they were working. Sight words, if you are unfamiliar with the term, refers to words that children “should” be able to recognize by sight. Sight words are high-frequency, appearing in many age-level texts, and in some cases non-decodable, or unable to be easily sounded out.

My research into sight words turned up two popular contenders: Dolch and Fry.

Dolch sight words are named after the educator, Edward Dolch, and were developed in the 1930s and 1940s by studying the most frequently occurring words in children’s books of that time. There are 220 words total and interestingly, none of them are nouns. Dolch did not include nouns because he felt they were dependent on the context of the book and therefore, not a reliable source of data for high frequency words. With that said, he did eventually compile a list of 95 nouns that he felt were high frequency enough to add to his body of work.

In terms of organization of his words, there are no indicators that Dolch himself organized the words by grade level or frequency. Subsequent iterations of the list have organized the words into those categories for him.

Fry sight words are slightly more recent having first been developed in 1957 and later revised in the 1980s by Edward Fry. Fry’s 1000 sight words are a culmination of word lists from the American Heritage list, which ranks the frequency of words taken from materials used in grades 3-9. Unlike Dolch, Fry included all parts of speech as part of his sight words and then organized them by frequency.

So which is better?

It’s hard to say. In my opinion, you could go with either one and be fine since the differences in their lists can be attributed to the source materials they consulted. Dolch was looking at words that children in grades K-2 would be reading, while Fry was looking at words that students in grades 3-9 would be reading. Fry is arguably more recent, but many of the words in Fry can be found in Dolch. In other words, it’s a toss up. The important thing to remember, I find, is to teach the words first before expecting students to memorize them.
