Another game from my America Reads days, Frank the Monster is a game where students draw a card, practice the concept on the card, and then “feed” the card to Frank. Since many of the students with whom I worked struggled with phonemic awareness, I had them practice letter-sound correspondence. A student would choose a card with a letter on it, say the sound(s) that the letter made, and then feed the card to Frank. As soon as they placed the card in Frank’s mouth, I would make a growling noise of appreciation and sometimes move the monster around a bit. While I was uncertain at first about how my students would react to their teacher making a cardboard box “growl”, I soon got over that fear. My students found the whole game hilarious and soon everyone in the class wanted to play with Frank. I was even asked to make Franks for students to practice with at home.

While I only used phonemic awareness cards with Frank, it is entirely possible to open it up to other subjects. I could see this being used for sight words or even basic addition and subtraction with the right cards.

## Frank the Monster: The Rules

**Players:** 2-4 plus the monster caretaker  
**Recommended Age:** Pre-K-1

The teacher has the role of monster caretaker. As the monster caretaker you can invite the players to gently pet the monster if they want, but only after they have fed him a card.

The monster caretaker spreads the cards out in front of the monster.

The players and the monster caretaker sit in a circle. Going clockwise, the monster caretaker invites players to pick up a card and practice the concept on the card. If the player gets the concept right, they may feed it to the monster. Upon feeding, the monster caretaker must shake the monster and make it growl. The game ends when all of the cards have been fed to the monster.

If you’re interested in practicing letter-sound correspondence with your students, I have included a freebie in my shop of the cards I used for this game.
