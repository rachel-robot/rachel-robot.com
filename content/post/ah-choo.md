Last year I worked as an America Reads tutor with at-risk students in the first grade. For those of you unfamiliar with the America Reads program, it is a work study program initiated by Bill Clinton that sends higher-ed students into public schools to work on issues related to literacy. During my placement, I worked with several children closely on issues of phonemic awareness, onset and rime, and general fluency. Most of our work was with instructional level texts and leveled books, however, I also created my own games for students to practice their literacy skills.

A particular favorite of my students was the game “Ah-choo!” It is a card game that uses sight words and sneezing elephants to help students develop and practice sight word recognition. A dealer shows cards to players and each player must say the sight word during their turn to keep it in their pile. Elephant cards are randomly distributed throughout the deck and if a player is shown an elephant card, they must “sneeze” like an elephant and the dealer takes their pile of cards. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.

While it can be played entirely by students, it is helpful if the dealer is a teacher because it is easier to differentiate the game for students. When I played the game with my students I would sometimes require that they use the sight word in a sentence or allow them to “phone a friend” to help them with a word they might not know. With the teacher as the dealer, the game is more accessible to everyone. It can be a good warm-up activity prior to a guided reading session.

## Ah-choo! The Rules

**Players**: 2-4 plus a dealer  
**Recommended Age**: K-2

The teacher is the dealer or the dealer is the student with the closest birthday to the date that month.

The players and the dealer sit in a circle. The dealer shuffles the cards and then shows a card to each player going clockwise around the circle. The player must say the sight word before taking the card. If the player encounters an elephant card, they must sneeze like an elephant and the dealer takes their cards. The player with the largest amount of cards remaining at the end of the game is the winner.

If you’re interested in Ah-choo! I have added versions to my TPT shop with both Dolch and Fry sight words.
