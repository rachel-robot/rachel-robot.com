Hello and welcome to my online teaching portfolio and blog!

My name is Rachel Luczkowski and I am a recent graduate of Bank Street College with a Masters of Science in Education! I just finished up the requirements for my initial certificate to teach in New York State and I was recently hired on to teach kindergarten. A mouthful. I know. It has been an exciting and challenging couple of years and I am looking forward to working in a classroom full time!

In preparation for the coming school year, I decided to create a space where I could share some of my work and thoughts about education. I am a notoriously awful blogger but I will try to keep this updated as I create and discover materials that I want to incorporate into my practice.

And lest I forget, a big thank you to Remi for helping make this space possible!

Feel free to follow along!
