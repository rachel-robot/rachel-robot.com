If you have been following this blog at all, you’ve probably picked up on the fact that my America Reads placement had a profound impact on my teaching practice. For over a year, I worked closely with several students on their reading and writing and in that time I learned a great deal about working with struggling readers. One of the most important things I learned from this experience was how to play to students’ interests and strengths as a way of motivating them to read.

One student with whom I worked, “Albert”, was a natural born storyteller. He had an anecdote for everything and was one of the most articulate students in the class. In spite of his loquacious nature though, Albert had a hard time with reading and writing. He would often call himself dumb and give up on assignments if he felt he was taking too long. I decided to do a little research and see if there was any way I could incorporate Albert’s language into our sessions to help him with his reading.

My research turned up a technique created by Roach VanAllen called the Language Experience Approach. The approach takes a student’s language and uses it as the basis for their learning. Put succinctly, it states that what a learner can say, they can write, what they can write, they can read. They can read what they write and what other people can write for them to read. The approach starts with an experience. The experience can be as simple as a walk in the park or as complex as making a three layer cake, so long as it leaves the students with an experience. Once the experience is established, the teacher then prompts the students to tell them about their experiences in their own words. The teacher records this language, either electronically or through other means, and then uses it to create original learning materials for the student.

As a tutor working during the school day, I was limited in the types of experiences I could provide Albert, but I eventually settled on working with wordless picture books. This turned out to be a perfect medium for Albert. He would tell me the stories using the pictures and I would write down his words. I then used his words to practice phonemic awareness and sight words with Albert.

Seeing the effect that wordless picture books had on Albert’s reading acquisition inspired me to create my own. I chose a fable for its simple storyline (and lack of human characters) and soon had my own version of the Ant and the Grasshopper.

Feel free to take a look and couple it with the language experience approach for your classroom!
