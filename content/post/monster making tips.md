In my previous post I had talked about the game Frank the Monster. Students draw cards, practice the concepts on those cards and then feed their cards to Frank. In this post, I’m going to teach you how to make a convincing monster.

To start, you’ll need a cardboard container large enough for small hands to drop cards into. I recommend tissue boxes but anything with a hand-sized opening will do. For this post, I have created two monsters, one from a tissue box and the other from an old oatmeal container to give you a rough idea of the appropriate size.

Once you have your cardboard container you need to decide how you will decorate the body. If you have access to acrylic paints you might want to go that route, but you may also decide to cover the box in construction paper, tissue paper, raffia, markers, etc. It all depends on what you have on hand.

With the body of the monster decorated, it is now time to turn your attention to its limbs. For this part, I highly recommend pipe cleaners. Poke a hole with an awl or a pen into the body of the monster and then insert the pipe cleaner. Decide how many and how long you want the limbs to be before bending the pipe cleaner to secure it on the interior of the body. You can also bend the limbs on the outside to resemble hands and feet. If you do not have access to pipe cleaners you might try cutting limbs out of cardboard or paper and gluing them to the body of the monster. It is not important for the limbs to work since the monster will be primarily situated on a table top or floor.

Now that the monster has a body and limbs, it needs a face. I like to start with the teeth. I tend to go for sharp teeth cut into triangles but you may decide to give your monster square teeth or rounded teeth. To create teeth, all you need is piece of paper and some scissors. Cut the teeth the length of the opening that is available to you on the monster body and then paste the teeth in with glue. Before pasting the teeth in, make sure that you can easily get your hand in and out of the opening since students will need to get cards in there. Once your monster has a nice smile, move on to the eyes and don’t be afraid to use more or less than two. Googly eyes are a good solution but you might also use pom poms or construction paper.

At this point, you should have a fairly presentable monster. However, if you’re still not satisfied, you can go back and add other features such as warts, tails, tongues, or horns. Just remember that the more intricate the monster becomes the more students will want to play with it. You’ll probably have to establish some rules about how to play gently with their new friend.
