So what’s with all the robots?

While my initial thought was to turn this site into an online teaching portfolio, I got caught up in all of the teaching blogs I was reading over the summer and decided to make my own dedicated blog spot for recording my practice. While I was at it, I also opened up a shop on Teachers Pay Teachers to share some of the materials that I talk about in my blog posts. 

Which brings us to the robots.

“Shops” on Teachers Pay Teachers have one of two names. You can either name the shop after yourself, or give it a title full of puns or alliteration. Since I am admittedly a little slow coming up with puns, and Rachel Luczkowski’s shop doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue, I went with Rachel-Robot. Once I had penciled myself into that box, I created the robots you see on the page and the rest is history.
